Python Operators
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:

# Python divides the operators in the following groups:

Arithmetic operators
Assignment operators
Comparison operators
Logical operators
Identity operators
Membership operators
Bitwise operators


Python Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:

Operator	 Example	      Same As
=	         x = 5	      x = 5	
+=	         x += 3	x = x + 3	
-=	x -= 3	x = x - 3	
*=	x *= 3	x = x * 3	
/=	x /= 3	x = x / 3	
%=	x %= 3	x = x % 3	
//=	x //= 3	x = x // 3	
**=	x **= 3	x = x ** 3	
&=	x &= 3	x = x & 3	
|=	x |= 3	x = x | 3	
^=	x ^= 3	x = x ^ 3	
>>=	x >>= 3	x = x >> 3	
<<=	x <<= 3	x = x << 3	
:=	print(x := 3)	x = 3
print(x)
